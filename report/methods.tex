                        \section{Methods}\label{sec:methods}
%describe the methods, the data, the assumptions, the scenarios, a brief few 
%sentences on Temoa itself.
This work collected data from multiple sources to populate a model of the 
Illinois electric grid, including existing generation capacities, potential 
generation technologies, the costs and wastes associated with each, and the 
electricity demand profile. This simulated representation of the state of 
Illinois relies on the Temoa framework, an open source tool built by 
researchers at \gls{NCSU}, which enables energy system optimization and 
techno-economic analysis 
\cite{decarolis_temoa_2010,decarolis_modelling_2016,decarolis_formalizing_2017}.

The technology models in Temoa representing energy source are configured with
data regarding fundamental techno-economic parameters such as their capacity,
capacity factors, seasonal generation profiles, auxiliary products, waste
generation metrics, and costs (fixed, capital, variable, and otherwise).
The Appendix \ref{sec:appendix} describe the key assumptions about electricity
generation and storage technologies in the Illinois model built for this
report.


\subsection{Optimization Analysis}
This work established optimal solutions to 
various scenarios which illuminate the potential impact of nuclear plant 
closures and other policy options on the cost of power in Illinois. These 
simulations  also explore Illinois' ability to meet aggressive proposed carbon 
goals with and without maintenance and expansion of nuclear power 
capacity. 

Assumptions and constraints in these simulated scenarios differentiate them. 
Each optimized scenario is the solution to a linear programming 
problem  comprised of two key components. First, the \emph{objective function}
minimizes the total system cost of the energy grid in the state of 
Illinois. 
Such an objective function is stated thus:

\begin{align}
\intertext{minimize} 
        &\sum_{g=1}^G\int_{t=2020}^{t=2050} c_g(t)\\
\intertext{where}
        G&=\text{number of generation technologies}&\nonumber\\
        x_g(t)&=\text{capacity of technology g in year t }[TW] &\nonumber\\
        c_g(t)&=\text{total cost of technology g in year t }\left[\frac{\$}{TW}\right]&\nonumber\\
              &= (l_g(t) + f_g(t) + v_g(t)cf_g(t)t)x_g(t)\nonumber\\
        l_g(t)&=\text{loan cost of technology g in year t }\left[\frac{\$}{TW}\right]&\nonumber\\
        f_g(t)&=\text{fixed cost of technology g in year t }\left[\frac{\$}{TW}\right]&\nonumber\\
        v_g(t)&=\text{variable cost of technology g in year t }\left[\frac{\$}{TW-year}\right]&\nonumber\\
        cf_g(t)&=\text{capacity factor of technology g in year t }[\%] .&\nonumber
\end{align}

Second, a set of constraints limit the model solutions. In this case, such 
constraints include balancing electric supply with electric demand, reducing 
carbon to zero by 2030, specifying renewable energy and energy
storage deployment speeds, and limiting land use based on availability.
All begin with the same initial condition which reflects the present energy generation infrastructure in Illinois. 
Then, optimization 
proceeds by varying all free parameters within the scope of the defined 
constraints in order to meet the objective. Ultimately, the simulation solution 
gives the energy generation mix, $\vec{x_g}$, for the Illinois electric grid that minimizes system cost. 
In this case, Temoa varies the 
deployed ratio of generation technologies on the Illinois electric grid, within 
the constraints of various policies, to minimize cost. The simulations each 
begin in the year 2020 and proceed through 2050.  The initial condition in 2020 
represents the true 2020 electricity generation mix in the state of Illinois.

model of Illinois' electric generation in the Temoa framework.

\subsection{Scenarios Simulated}\label{sec:simulations}

Table \ref{tab:scenarios} describes the scenarios we conducted.
All share the same objective function, which seeks to minimize total system cost.
They are clustered in four major categories. First, the \gls{BAU} cases assume 
no carbon limit, while the \gls{CC} cases assume a zero 
carbon target in 2030. Comparing these two simulation categories reveals the 
potential impact of carbon limits and premature nuclear energy closure on 
the minimum achievable cost. These simulations make conservative assumptions 
about the cost and availability of advanced nuclear power. 

To explore the importance of these assumptions, two additional classes of 
simulations were explored. In the \gls{XN} cases, advanced 
nuclear reactors are assumed to be twice as expensive to build than the best 
conservative estimates. In the \gls{ZN} cases, advanced 
nuclear power is not available in time to contribute to carbon reductions in 
Illinois before 2050. These scenarios are summarized in Table 
\ref{tab:scenarios}.

\subsection{Constraints}
Some constraints are shared among all scenarios:
\begin{itemize}
        \item The initial conditions reflect the true 2020 energy mix in Illinois.
        \item Power supply must meet power demand in each time step.
        \item Strategic planning reserve must be greater than 15\% of demand.
        \item Technology models are identical across all simulations with the 
                exception of the capital cost of advanced nuclear, which is 
                altered for the \gls{XN} scenarios.  
\end{itemize}

The simulations diverge due to their differing treatment of constraints related 
to the timing of nuclear plant closures, inclusion of 
carbon targets, and land-use limits for the growth of renewables.

\subsubsection{Byron and Dresden Closures}
In each family of scenarios, the impact of closing Byron \& Dresden was explored 
by assuming one of three assumptions. The two plants either:
\begin{itemize} 
        \item close prematurely, in 2021,
        \item close as scheduled, when their current licenses expire in 20 and 10 
        years, or
        \item receive license extensions and continue operating through 2050.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Other Existing Nuclear}
In each family of scenarios, the other existing nuclear power plants in 
Illinois were  either:
\begin{itemize}
        \item decommissioned as scheduled according to their current 
licenses, or 
        \item awarded license extensions and continue operating through 2050.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Zero Carbon Target}
In the business as usual cases (\gls{BAU}1-3), the simulations were not carbon limited. In all 
other simulations, a linear reduction in carbon emissions beginning in 2020 and 
reaching zero carbon emissions by 2030. This constrains energy 
deployment options in those simulations.

\subsubsection{Renewable Growth Rate}
In the business-as-usual cases, the growth rate for renewable energy is limited by economics, 
primarily. In the carbon constrained and expensive nuclear scenarios, an 
optimistic growth rate is enabled.
In those cases, utility scale solar is allowed to grow to 10 GWe by 2030, 
reflecting the aggressive and optimistic build out proposed in the Illinois 
Clean Energy Jobs Act. Similarly, wind turbine deployments grow to 13.8 GWe 
by 2030. Finally, residential solar is allowed to 
increase at a steady rate, but is capped at 75\% of the technical resource 
availability to reflect deployment on 75\% of Illinois buildings 
\cite{gagnon_rooftop_2016}. 

Without preserving existing nuclear or deploying advanced reactors, the
required land use for solar and wind generation is infeasible, since the 
Illinois land appropriate for wind and solar is already in use as vital 
farmland. The southern and central regions of Illinois most suitable for solar 
power installations are the same regions the nation currently relies on for 
15\% of its corn and 14\% of its soybeans \cite{schleusener_illinois_2020}.  

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
        \begin{center}
                \includegraphics[height=0.4\textheight]{solar-suitability.png}\\
                \vspace{0.5cm}
                \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{corn-and-soy.png}
        \end{center}
        \caption{Corn (bottom left) and soybean (bottom right) crops in Illinois lie predominantly in the 
        same portion of the state corresponding to the 
        region of highest solar panel suitability (top) 
        \cite{schleusener_illinois_2020,eispc_energy_2021,sengupta_national_2018}.}
        \label{fig:corn-and-soy}
\end{figure}


Specifically, strategies which allow nuclear plants to close before 2050 require 10,000$km^2$ of this land to be dedicated to solar as well as 4\% of Illinois' land area in use for rooftop solar. Keeping the nuclear plants open through 2050 halves this requirement.  
The constraints on utility scale wind and solar are lifted. It is not possible to achieve zero carbon without advanced nuclear under the above constraints.

\subsection{Demand Model}
Illinois electricity demand has remained steady at approximately 140.7 TWh per 
year for the last decade 
\cite{us_energy_information_administration_eia_illinois_2020}. All scenarios 
simulated in this report assume that this demand remains steady annually.
If Illinois transportation is fully electrified by 2050, this assumption will 
not be valid.  However, postulating such growth scenarios is  beyond the scope 
of this report. 

As part of model configuration, the Temoa framework accepts demand profiles 
capturing seasonal and daily fluctuations. The typical Illinois hourly demand profile and seasonal variation in hourly demand were both retrieved from the \gls{EIA} 
\cite{us_energy_information_administration_eia_illinois_2020}. Figure 
\ref{fig:seasonal_hourly_demand} shows the variation in hourly demand.
In our simulations, the demand is seasonally modulated by this information.
