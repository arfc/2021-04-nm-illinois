\section{Discussion}


Baker et. al found that increasing penetration of renewables increases grid
volatility which exponentially increased the \gls{LCOE} of the energy system when
subject to a mismatch penalty. They also found that energy storage becomes
increasingly valuable for grid stability at or above 20\% renewable
penetration.
