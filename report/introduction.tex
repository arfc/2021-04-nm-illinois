\section{Introduction}
Eleven (11) emissions-free nuclear reactors at 6 sites produce the majority of
electricity in Illinois and critically underpin its clean energy future. Four 
of these reactors, representing over 4GWe of electric capacity are at the Byron 
and Dresden plants which face premature closure. This
report quantitatively demonstrates the role nuclear energy must play in
minimizing cost while meeting Illinoisâ€™ carbon goals through 2050, with a 
particular focus on those plants. 

We have 
modeled the Illinois electric grid and conducted optimization simulations of 
key policy scenarios. These simulations establish the least costly energy 
generation mixtures with and without the at-risk plants in the context of 
various policy factors, such as zero-emissions targets. With these solutions, we 
compared and contrasted the economic and carbon implications of
these energy futures. In addition to emissions, this report also considers
other environmental impacts of available energy choices, such as land use and
solid waste generation.
