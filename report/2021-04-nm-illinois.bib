	abstract = {Energy system optimization models ({ESOMs}) should be used in an interactive way to uncover knifeedge solutions, explore alternative system configurations, and suggest different ways to achieve policy objectives under conditions of deep uncertainty. In this paper, we do so by employing an existing optimization technique called modeling to generate alternatives ({MGA}), which involves a change in the model structure in order to systematically explore the near-optimal decision space. The {MGA} capability is incorporated into Tools for Energy Model Optimization and Analysis (Temoa), an open source framework that also includes a technology rich, bottom up {ESOM}. In this analysis, Temoa is used to explore alternative energy futures in a simplified single region energy system that represents the U.S. electric sector and a portion of the light duty transport sector. Given the dataset limitations, we place greater emphasis on the methodological approach rather than specific results.},

	title = {Projected Costs of Generating Electricity - 2020 Edition},
	abstract = {At a moment when the {COVID}-19 pandemic has not yet subsided, creating the appropriate
frameworks for ensuring adequate investment in the power sectors of {OECD} and non‐{OECD}
countries alike is of paramount importance. This is especially relevant at a moment where many
governments are initiating targeted stimulus packages to support the economy. Many of these
packages include measures to accelerate the countries’ clean energy transitions – a shift from
carbon-intensive electricity generation to low-carbon technologies, setting all areas of the economy
and society on a more sustainable path.
Affordability will be a key consideration in designing those transitions. Decision makers in
policy and industry, assisted by modellers and energy experts, will have to chart a way forward
in increasingly complex contexts. Doing so will require reliable and relevant information. This is
where this joint publication by the International Energy Agency ({IEA}) and the {OECD} Nuclear Energy
Agency ({NEA}) comes in. Projected Costs of Generating Electricity – 2020 Edition is the ninth edition of
their joint report on electricity generating costs by the major power generation technologies in
24 different countries.
Any comparison of generation costs today must also consider our rapidly changing power
systems. As in previous editions, this edition uses the levelised cost of electricity ({LCOE}) as a well-
established, uniquely transparent and intuitive metric, widely used in policy making, modelling
and public discussion. As the shares of wind and solar {PV} in our power systems grow, the value
of the electricity generated by a particular technology in a particular power system also changes.
Thus, this report also presents a new complementary metric, the “value-adjusted” {LCOE} to account
for these impacts. In addition, five “boundary chapters” take a step back to discuss different aspects
of the evolving electricity systems of today and tomorrow in a broad and dynamic long-term
perspective.
Altogether, the different elements of Projected Costs of Generating Electricity – 2020 Edition aim
at contributing to a sound informational infrastructure for forward-looking decision making in
decarbonising energy sectors. In this context, knowing the costs and system value of different
electricity generation options and, in particular, of low-carbon generation, is indispensable.},

	abstract = {Energy systems are undergoing a significant shift to renewable energy ({RE}). To date, the surface area required for {RE} systems is greater than that for non-{RE} systems, exacerbating existing environmental policy challenges, from increasing land competition, to visual impacts. A suitable metric for comparing the extent of systems is the power density of electricity production, that is, the electrical power produced per horizontal m2 of surface area. This study systematically reviews power densities for 9 energy-types (wind, solar etc.) and multiple sub-types (e.g., for solar power: {PV}, solar thermal) in the United States. Median, mean, and uncertainty estimates are provided for 177 different densities from the literature. Non-renewable power densities are found to be three orders of magnitude larger than renewable densities. Natural gas and solar energy yield the highest median density per non-{RE}, and {RE} system respectively. Solar energy was the only system to experience a significant, positive relationship in power density over time. We apply these density estimates to {NREL} scenarios of future energy systems for state-specific assessments, and find that the largest growth in land use is in the southern United States.},

To address this shortcoming, we draw on our collective modelling experience and conduct an extensive literature review to formalize best practice for energy system optimization modelling. We begin by articulating a set of overarching principles that can be used to guide {ESOM}-based analysis. To help operationalize the guiding principles, we outline and explain critical steps in the modelling process, including how to formulate research questions, set spatio-temporal boundaries, consider appropriate model features, conduct and refine the analysis, quantify uncertainty, and communicate insights. We highlight the need to develop and refine formal guidance on {ESOM} application, which comes at a critical time as {ESOMs} are being used to inform national climate targets.},

Verification of the turbine positions was done by visual interpretation using high-resolution aerial imagery in {ESRI} {ArcGIS} Desktop. A locational error of plus or minus 10 meters for turbine locations was tolerated. Technical specifications for turbines were assigned based on the wind turbine make and models as provided by manufacturers and project developers directly, and via {FAA} datasets, {AWEA}, information on the wind project developer or turbine manufacturer websites, or other online sources. Some facility and turbine information on make and model did not exist or was difficult to obtain. Thus, uncertainty may exist for certain turbine specifications. Similarly, some turbines were not yet built, not built at all, or for other reasons cannot be verified visually. Location and turbine specifications data quality are rated and a confidence is recorded for both. None of the data are field verified.},

	abstract = {There has been an intense debate on the quantification of the employment effects of renewable electricity deployment in the European Union. However, most studies carried out in the past have focused on specific countries and those with a European-wide scope have not provided disaggregated results per country. Furthermore, differences between importing and exporting countries have not been considered. This paper aims to cover those gaps. It presents a novel methodology which integrates the aforementioned considerations in order to calculate the employment effects of renewable energy deployment. The methodology is useful to calculate dynamic employment factors (considering technology learning effects) and the specific capacity (based on trade effects) to which these factors should be applied. It is applied to three renewable energy technologies – photovoltaics, wind on-shore and wind off-shore- in the European Union Member States in the 2008–2012 period. The results using this novel methodology broadly confirm the figures provided in other contributions in the literature. The proposed methodology can be instrumental in assessing the socio-economic effects of policies and investment programmes targeting the deployment of renewable energy technologies.},

	shorttitle = {Employment factors for wind and solar energy technologies},
	abstract = {In this paper we present an up-to-date literature review on employment opportunities associated with the deployment of renewable energy technology. We identified approximately 70 studies and data sources published over the past decade that report analysed or observed employment impacts of renewable energy growth. These publications cover many different countries and several technology options, and present widely varying results derived from distinct methodological approaches. Our first overall conclusion is that there is clear lack of authenticity of findings in this literature, since recursive referencing abounds and relatively few studies yield truly original research. When we omit non-authentic analyses, as well as those that aggregate results in a way that does not allow us to calculate ‘employment factors’ (defined as the number of jobs or amount of work generated per unit of electricity production capacity), the total list of references is brought to 31 independent items. Of these, only 14 references provide separate estimates of the employment factors for the stages of manufacturing and installation, respectively, as opposed to employment factors for these two activities combined. A total of 23 items provide values for operation and maintenance (O\&M) employment factors. We observe significant uncertainties in quoted figures for job creation, both across and within publications.},
