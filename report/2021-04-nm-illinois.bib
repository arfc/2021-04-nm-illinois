	abstract = {Path to zero carbon emissions
Models show that to avert dangerous levels of climate change, global carbon dioxide emissions must fall to zero later this century. Most of these emissions arise from energy use. Davis et al. review what it would take to achieve decarbonization of the energy system. Some parts of the energy system are particularly difficult to decarbonize, including aviation, long-distance transport, steel and cement production, and provision of a reliable electricity supply. Current technologies and pathways show promise, but integration of now-discrete energy sectors and industrial processes is vital to achieve minimal emissions.

Structured Abstract
BACKGROUNDNet emissions of CO2 by human activities{\textemdash}including not only energy services and industrial production but also land use and agriculture{\textemdash}must approach zero in order to stabilize global mean temperature. Energy services such as light-duty transportation, heating, cooling, and lighting may be relatively straightforward to decarbonize by electrifying and generating electricity from variable renewable energy sources (such as wind and solar) and dispatchable ({\textquotedblleft}on-demand{\textquotedblright}) nonrenewable sources (including nuclear energy and fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage). However, other energy services essential to modern civilization entail emissions that are likely to be more difficult to fully eliminate. These difficult-to-decarbonize energy services include aviation, long-distance transport, and shipping; production of carbon-intensive structural materials such as steel and cement; and provision of a reliable electricity supply that meets varying demand. Moreover, demand for such services and products is projected to increase substantially over this century. The long-lived infrastructure built today, for better or worse, will shape the future.Here, we review the special challenges associated with an energy system that does not add any CO2 to the atmosphere (a net-zero emissions energy system). We discuss prominent technological opportunities and barriers for eliminating and/or managing emissions related to the difficult-to-decarbonize services; pitfalls in which near-term actions may make it more difficult or costly to achieve the net-zero emissions goal; and critical areas for research, development, demonstration, and deployment. It may take decades to research, develop, and deploy these new technologies.
ADVANCESA successful transition to a future net-zero emissions energy system is likely to depend on vast amounts of inexpensive, emissions-free electricity; mechanisms to quickly and cheaply balance large and uncertain time-varying differences between demand and electricity generation; electrified substitutes for most fuel-using devices; alternative materials and manufacturing processes for structural materials; and carbon-neutral fuels for the parts of the economy that are not easily electrified. Recycling and removal of carbon from the atmosphere (carbon management) is also likely to be an important activity of any net-zero emissions energy system. The specific technologies that will be favored in future marketplaces are largely uncertain, but only a finite number of technology choices exist today for each functional role. To take appropriate actions in the near term, it is imperative to clearly identify desired end points. To achieve a robust, reliable, and affordable net-zero emissions energy system later this century, efforts to research, develop, demonstrate, and deploy those candidate technologies must start now.
OUTLOOKCombinations of known technologies could eliminate emissions related to all essential energy services and processes, but substantial increases in costs are an immediate barrier to avoiding emissions in each category. In some cases, innovation and deployment can be expected to reduce costs and create new options. More rapid changes may depend on coordinating operations across energy and industry sectors, which could help boost utilization rates of capital-intensive assets, but this will require overcoming institutional and organizational challenges in order to create new markets and ensure cooperation among regulators and disparate, risk-averse businesses. Two parallel and broad streams of research and development could prove useful: research in technologies and approaches that can decarbonize provision of the most difficult-to-decarbonize energy services, and research in systems integration that would allow reliable and cost-effective provision of these services. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/360/6396/eaas9793/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint A shower of molten metal in a steel foundry.Industrial processes such as steelmaking will be particularly challenging to decarbonize. Meeting future demand for such difficult-to-decarbonize energy services and industrial products without adding CO2 to the atmosphere may depend on technological cost reductions via research and innovation, as well as coordinated deployment and integration of operations across currently discrete energy industries.
Some energy services and industrial processes{\textemdash}such as long-distance freight transport, air travel, highly reliable electricity, and steel and cement manufacturing{\textemdash}are particularly difficult to provide without adding carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere. Rapidly growing demand for these services, combined with long lead times for technology development and long lifetimes of energy infrastructure, make decarbonization of these services both essential and urgent. We examine barriers and opportunities associated with these difficult-to-decarbonize services and processes, including possible technological solutions and research and development priorities. A range of existing technologies could meet future demands for these services and processes without net addition of CO2 to the atmosphere, but their use may depend on a combination of cost reductions via research and innovation, as well as coordinated deployment and integration of operations across currently discrete energy industries.},

In this paper, we do so by employing an existing optimization technique called modeling to generate alternatives (MGA), which involves a change in the model structure in order to systematically explore the near-optimal decision space. The MGA capability is incorporated into Tools for Energy Model Optimization and Analysis (Temoa), an open source framework that also includes a technology rich, bottom up ESOM. In this analysis, Temoa is used to explore alternative energy futures in a simplified single region energy system that represents the U.S. electric sector and a portion of the light duty transport sector. Given the dataset limitations, we place greater emphasis on the methodological approach rather than specific results.},

	abstract = {At a moment when the COVID-19 pandemic has not yet subsided, creating the appropriate
frameworks for ensuring adequate investment in the power sectors of OECD and non-OECD
countries alike is of paramount importance. This is especially relevant at a moment where many
governments are initiating targeted stimulus packages to support the economy. Many of these
packages include measures to accelerate the countries{\textquoteright} clean energy transitions {\textendash} a shift from
carbon-intensive electricity generation to low-carbon technologies, setting all areas of the economy
and society on a more sustainable path.
Affordability will be a key consideration in designing those transitions. Decision makers in
policy and industry, assisted by modellers and energy experts, will have to chart a way forward
in increasingly complex contexts. Doing so will require reliable and relevant information. This is
where this joint publication by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the OECD Nuclear Energy
Agency (NEA) comes in. Projected Costs of Generating Electricity {\textendash} 2020 Edition is the ninth edition of
their joint report on electricity generating costs by the major power generation technologies in
24 different countries.
Any comparison of generation costs today must also consider our rapidly changing power
systems. As in previous editions, this edition uses the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) as a well-
established, uniquely transparent and intuitive metric, widely used in policy making, modelling
and public discussion. As the shares of wind and solar PV in our power systems grow, the value
of the electricity generated by a particular technology in a particular power system also changes.
Thus, this report also presents a new complementary metric, the {\textquotedblleft}value-adjusted{\textquotedblright} LCOE to account
for these impacts. In addition, five {\textquotedblleft}boundary chapters{\textquotedblright} take a step back to discuss different aspects
of the evolving electricity systems of today and tomorrow in a broad and dynamic long-term
perspective.
Altogether, the different elements of Projected Costs of Generating Electricity {\textendash} 2020 Edition aim
at contributing to a sound informational infrastructure for forward-looking decision making in
decarbonising energy sectors. In this context, knowing the costs and system value of different
electricity generation options and, in particular, of low-carbon generation, is indispensable.},

	abstract = {Energy systems are undergoing a significant shift to renewable energy (RE). To date, the surface area required for RE systems is greater than that for non-RE systems, exacerbating existing environmental policy challenges, from increasing land competition, to visual impacts. A suitable metric for comparing the extent of systems is the power density of electricity production, that is, the electrical power produced per horizontal m2 of surface area. This study systematically reviews power densities for 9 energy-types (wind, solar etc.) and multiple sub-types (e.g., for solar power: PV, solar thermal) in the United States. Median, mean, and uncertainty estimates are provided for 177 different densities from the literature. Non-renewable power densities are found to be three orders of magnitude larger than renewable densities. Natural gas and solar energy yield the highest median density per non-RE, and RE system respectively. Solar energy was the only system to experience a significant, positive relationship in power density over time. We apply these density estimates to NREL scenarios of future energy systems for state-specific assessments, and find that the largest growth in land use is in the southern United States.},

	abstract = {There has been an intense debate on the quantification of the employment effects of renewable electricity deployment in the European Union. However, most studies carried out in the past have focused on specific countries and those with a European-wide scope have not provided disaggregated results per country. Furthermore, differences between importing and exporting countries have not been considered. This paper aims to cover those gaps. It presents a novel methodology which integrates the aforementioned considerations in order to calculate the employment effects of renewable energy deployment. The methodology is useful to calculate dynamic employment factors (considering technology learning effects) and the specific capacity (based on trade effects) to which these factors should be applied. It is applied to three renewable energy technologies {\textendash} photovoltaics, wind on-shore and wind off-shore- in the European Union Member States in the 2008{\textendash}2012 period. The results using this novel methodology broadly confirm the figures provided in other contributions in the literature. The proposed methodology can be instrumental in assessing the socio-economic effects of policies and investment programmes targeting the deployment of renewable energy technologies.},

	abstract = {This dataset provides locations and technical specifications of wind turbines in the United States, almost all of which are utility-scale. Utility-scale turbines are ones which generate power and feed it into the grid, supplying a utility with energy. They are usually much larger than turbines that would feed a homeowner or business. The regularly-updated database has wind turbine records that have been collected, digitized, and locationally verified. Turbine data were gathered from the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Digital Obstacle File (DOF) and Obstruction Evaluation Airport Airspace Analysis (OE-AAA), the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), and the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and were merged and collapsed into a single data set. Verification of the turbine positions was done by visual interpretation using high-resolution aerial imagery in ESRI ArcGIS Desktop. A locational error of plus or minus 10 meters for turbine locations was tolerated. Technical specifications for turbines were assigned based on the wind turbine make and models as provided by manufacturers and project developers directly, and via FAA datasets, AWEA, information on the wind project developer or turbine manufacturer websites, or other online sources. Some facility and turbine information on make and model did not exist or was difficult to obtain. Thus, uncertainty may exist for certain turbine specifications. Similarly, some turbines were not yet built, not built at all, or for other reasons cannot be verified visually. Location and turbine specifications data quality are rated and a confidence is recorded for both. None of the data are field verified.},

We identified approximately 70 studies and data sources published over the past decade that report analysed or observed employment impacts of renewable energy growth. These publications cover many different countries and several technology options, and present widely varying results derived from distinct methodological approaches. Our first overall conclusion is that there is clear lack of authenticity of findings in this literature, since recursive referencing abounds and relatively few studies yield truly original research. When we omit non-authentic analyses, as well as those that aggregate results in a way that does not allow us to calculate {\textquoteleft}employment factors{\textquoteright} (defined as the number of jobs or amount of work generated per unit of electricity production capacity), the total list of references is brought to 31 independent items. Of these, only 14 references provide separate estimates of the employment factors for the stages of manufacturing and installation, respectively, as opposed to employment factors for these two activities combined. A total of 23 items provide values for operation and maintenance (O\&M) employment factors. We observe significant uncertainties in quoted figures for job creation, both across and within publications.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a thorough review of 75 modelling tools currently used for analysing energy and electricity systems. Increased activity within model development in recent years has led to several new models and modelling capabilities, partly motivated by the need to better represent the integration of variable renewables. The purpose of this paper is to give an updated overview of currently available modelling tools, their capabilities and to serve as an aid for modellers in their process of identifying and choosing an appropriate model. A broad spectrum of modelling tools, ranging from small-scale power system analysis tools to global long-term energy models, has been assessed. Key information regarding the general logic, spatiotemporal resolution as well as the technological and economic features of the models is presented in three comprehensive tables. This information has been validated and updated by model developers or affiliated contact persons, and is state-of-the-art as of the submission date. With the available suite of modelling tools, most challenges of today's electricity system can be assessed. For a future with an increasing share of variable renewables and increasing electrification of the energy system, there are some challenges such as how to represent short-term variability in long-term studies, incorporate the effect of climate change and ensure openness and transparency in modelling studies.},

We then estimate the possibility of reducing absolute material production energy by half, while doubling production from the present to 2050. The goal therefore is a 75 per cent reduction in energy intensity. Four technology-based strategies are investigated, regardless of cost: (i) widespread application of best available technology (BAT), (ii)~BAT to cutting-edge technologies, (iii) aggressive recycling and finally, and (iv) significant improvements in recycling technologies. Taken together, these aggressive strategies could produce impressive gains, of the order of a 50{\textendash}56 per cent reduction in energy intensity, but this is still short of our goal of a 75 per cent reduction. Ultimately, we face fundamental thermodynamic as well as practical constraints on our ability to improve the energy intensity of material production. A strategy to reduce demand by providing material services with less material (called {\textquoteleft}material efficiency{\textquoteright}) is outlined as an approach to solving this dilemma.},

attributable to variable generation to ensure the stability of the bulk power grid. Long-term
historical data sets allow for characterization and trending of key performance metrics, including
those factors that contribute to resource availability and adequacy. Variable generation, like
wind and solar, does not have long-term historical data sets, and this lack of data limits the
understanding of the long-term implications of variable generation performance. The potential
output levels of variable generation show a large degree of variance over a vast geographic scale,
so the ideal type and capacity contribution of variable generation will differ by region. This
report discusses the known characteristics of regional variable generation along with the current
practices used by systems planners to predict variable generation output potential and capacity
contribution during peak-demand hours to ensure grid reliability},

	abstract = {The planning reserve margin is the predominant metric used in long-term planning models to ensure the resource adequacy of projected power systems. Considerable work has been done to estimate the contribution of variable renewable energy resources, such as wind and solar, to the planning reserve margin, but little work has been done to assess what planning reserve margin should be used in planning models. Typically, U.S.-based models use the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)-recommended reserve margin levels. However, historical reserve margins have often exceeded the NERC-recommended levels, suggesting that the use of NERC-recommended levels in planning models may negatively bias projected future capacity investments relative to real-world trends. Using the Regional Energy Deployment System capacity expansion model, we show that setting the planning reserve margin to observed levels in lieu of the NERC-recommended levels leads to substantial differences in near-term capacity additions. Scenarios using alternative specifications for the reserve margin resulted in increased national solar builds of 20{\textendash}100 GW. Given that the magnitude on results from altering the reserve margin level is similar to or greater than many policies frequently analyzed with planning models, careful consideration of the reserve margin level is crucial for developing accurate power sector projections.},

	url = {https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy16osti/65298.pdf},
	abstract = {This report quantifies the technical potential of photovoltaic (PV) systems deployed on rooftops in
the continental United States, estimating how much energy could be generated by installing PV on
all suitable roof area. The results do not exclude systems based on their economic performance, and
thus they provide an upper bound on potential deployment rather than a prediction of actual
deployment.
Although methods have been developed to estimate rooftop PV technical potential at the individual
building level, previous estimates at the regional and national levels have lacked a rigorous
foundation in geospatial data and statistical analysis. This report helps fill this gap by providing a
detailed data-driven analysis of U.S. (national, state, and ZIP-code level) rooftop PV availability
and technical electricity-generation potential. First, we use light detection and ranging (lidar) data,
geographic information system (GIS) methods, and PV-generation modeling to calculate the
suitability of rooftops for hosting PV in 128 cities nationwide{\textemdash}representing approximately 23\% of
U.S. buildings{\textemdash}and we provide PV-generation results for a subset of these cities. Second, we
extend the insights from this analysis of areas covered by lidar data to the entire continental United
States. We develop two statistical models{\textemdash}one for small buildings and one for medium and large
buildings{\textemdash}that estimate the total amount of roof area suitable for hosting PV systems, and we
simulate the productivity of PV modules on the roof area to arrive at the nationwide technical
potential for PV.
Our analysis of the trends in the suitability of rooftops for hosting PV systems reveals important
variations in this key driver of rooftop PV technical potential that have not been captured by
previous approaches. Figure ES-1 shows the results{\textemdash}from our statistical modeling grounded in
lidar data{\textemdash}for the percentage of small buildings that are suitable for PV in each ZIP code in the
continental United States. In the figure we can identify regional trends in the suitability of small
building rooftops, with high densities of suitable small buildings in California, Florida, and the
West South Central census division. Such trends are also critical to estimating PV technical
potential at finer resolution, and our report illustrates this with a high-resolution analysis of 11
representative cities.
Figure ES-2 shows the annual energy generation potential from rooftop PV as a percentage of each
state{\textquoteright}s electricity sales in 2013. The estimates of energy generation are based on the rooftop
suitability of small, medium, and large buildings as well as specific roof orientations, local solar
resources, PV system performance assumptions, and building footprints.},

	abstract = {The limited literature on the cost of various recycling methodologies for thermoset composites sets the background of this work, focusing mainly on the identification of an upper and lower economic value of glass fibre recovered from wind turbine blades recycling. The study briefly reviews the materials used by various original equipment manufacturers (OEM) for wind turbine blades. Successively, it provides an overview of the various recycling methods with interest in recovered materials, mechanical and physical properties, which are used, for estimating a maximum expected value. All recycling processes show a negative effect on mechanical properties with strength loss between 30\% and 60\%. Process energy demands are reviewed, and considerations are set forward to estimate the minimum cost of operating mechanical, pyrolysis and fluidized bed plants in Germany. Ultimately, current applications of recovered material and related markets are explored. Through interviews and secondary data, it is highlighted that despite the lower mechanical properties, grinded material finds applications in traditional processes, cement kilns and new products. It is also found that pyrolysed fibres can be used as insulation material and oils can be easy to distil. Pyrolysis is a relatively expensive process, thereby, distillation of the oils and energy recovery are necessary enablers towards commercial viability. Mechanically grinded material presents the lowest process cost with ca. {\texteuro}90/tonne, thus, below landfilling and incineration and falling within the attention of private businesses. Numerous markets are available for recovered materials from wind turbine blades, primarily for grinded products and secondly for pyrolysed glass fibre.},

	abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are currently one of the most important electrochemical energy storage devices, powering electronic mobile devices and electric vehicles alike. However, there is a remarkable difference between their rate of production and rate of recycling. At the end of their lifecycle, only a limited number of LIBs undergo any recycling treatment, with the majority go to landfills or being hoarded in households. Further losses of LIB components occur because the the state-of-the-art LIB recycling processes are limited to components with high economic value, e.g., Co, Cu, Fe, and Al. With the increasing popularity of concepts such as \&ldquo;circular economy\&rdquo; (CE), new LIB recycling systems have been proposed that target a wider spectrum of compounds, thus reducing the environmental impact associated with LIB production. This review work presents a discussion of the current practices and some of the most promising emerging technologies for recycling LIBs. While other authoritative reviews have focused on the description of recycling processes, the aim of the present was is to offer an analysis of recycling technologies from a CE perspective. Consequently, the discussion is based on the ability of each technology to recover every component in LIBs. The gathered data depicted a direct relationship between process complexity and the variety and usability of the recovered fractions. Indeed, only processes employing a combination of mechanical processing, and hydro- and pyrometallurgical steps seemed able to obtain materials suitable for LIB (re)manufacture. On the other hand, processes relying on pyrometallurgical steps are robust, but only capable of recovering metallic components.},

	abstract = {On August 26, 2020, Exelon announced its intention to retire two of its nuclear power plants in Illinois (Byron and
Dresden Generating Stations). In October 2019 Clean Air Task Force (CATF) released an analysis of the significant
health impacts that would result from the loss of four nuclear plants. At the time, CATF also analyzed the impacts of
the loss of two nuclear plants but did not report those results as their loss was encompassed within the more
comprehensive analysis. Given the relevance of the two plant results, CATF has updated its 2019 report accordingly.
Using proven US EPA modeling tools CATF has determined that loss of zero emission generation from the retirement
of two or four nuclear power plants in Illinois would result in the following cumulative health-related impacts and costs
over a ten-year period:},
