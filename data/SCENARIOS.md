## High Demand
|Scenario ID|Scenario Name|Description|
|:-----|------:|:---------------------|
|HD2|Premature Shutdown|The case where Byron and Dresden nuclear plants are allowed to shutdown before their licenses expire.|
|HD3|Renewable Only|The case where nuclear is phased out and Illinois achieves 100% renewable electricity by 2050|
|HD4|Zero Emissions Credits|The case where Illinois expands zero emissions credits to the other four nuclear nuclear plants.|
|HD5|Moratorium Lifted|The case where Illinois lifts the moratorium on construction of new nuclear plants.|


* HDx corresponds to a "high demand" growth where, for example, the Illinois
transportation sector is 100% electrified.
* SDx corresponds to a "steady demand" scenario with virtually no growth in
demand.
